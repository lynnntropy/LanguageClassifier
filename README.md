# LanguageClassifier

LanguageClassifier is a Python application that uses machine learning to distinguish between (romanized) Japanese and Korean words.

This is a college project, built for the Artificial Intelligence course at Subotica Tech.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- tqdm

A `requirements.txt` isn't included on purpose, because many of these packages have an... interesting installation story, and can't really simply be installed via `pip`.

## Running

```bash
python classifier.py
```
